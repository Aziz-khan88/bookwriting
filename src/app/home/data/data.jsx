Someone responded and at first I didn’t write anything back. But then I decided to take a chance and the person I talked to put me in contact with Mark Rivera. Mark and his team have been very helpful during this whole process. They take my suggestions and show me where I can make improvements.",

Their editing team did a great job on the design of the book cover, and formatting of the text for uploading onto KDP for print and ebook made it feasible for me to swiftly self-publish my book. Their staff was quick to reply to my queries, sometimes the same day, and provided me with excellent advice throughout. Furthermore, in comparison to many other publishing firms, their services were inexpensive. I'd recommend them to everybody who's just started out with their writing career!",
